<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there, I am Domeneak Addison a IT Web & Software Devlopment graduate. Born and raised in Milwaukee, WI, I found my love for Software Development early in high school while taking a Web Development course.
  Since then, I have had an interest in making websites and everything in between. </p>

<p>While in college, I've learned many programming languages such as Java, C#, C++, and Javascript. While also having knowledge of programs such as NodeJS, MongoDB, Postman, & APIs. Java being my favorite programming language to use.</p>

<p>I have had short and long term goals for my career. I currently have 5 years of financial/ banking front and back office experience. My original goal was to work within the IT team of my respective bank. yet unfortunately, many IT teams are being outsourced to other countries, leaving some people without jobs and looking for more. But since then, I want to open up a computer part store akin to Microcenter. So that others like me who likes computer, electronics and building them will have a place to frequent and a place they know the parts will be available.</p>
